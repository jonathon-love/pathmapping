Description: Functions to compute and display the area-based deviation between paths and to compute a mapping based on minimizing area and distance-based cost.  For details, see: Mueller, Perelman, and Veinott. (under review). An optimization approach for mapping and measuring the divergence and correspondence between paths, Behavior Research Methods.
